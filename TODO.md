# TODO List for Transfer Window Calculator Project

- [ ] Create planet.py: Define Planet class with properties like semi-major axis, mass, initial mean anomaly.
- [ ] Create transfer_calculator.py: Implement functions for calculating orbital periods, mean longitudes, phase angle, and transfer window times.
- [ ] Create main.py: Build Tkinter GUI with input fields for planet parameters and display phase angle and transfer window info.
- [ ] Test the application: Run the script and verify calculations with sample inputs.
