# TODO List for Transfer Window Calculator Project

- [x] Create planet.py: Define Planet class with properties like semi-major axis, mass, initial mean anomaly.
- [x] Create transfer_calculator.py: Implement functions for calculating orbital periods, mean longitudes, phase angle, and transfer window times.
- [x] Create main.py: Build Tkinter GUI with input fields for planet parameters and display phase angle and transfer window info.
- [x] Test the application: Run the script and verify calculations with sample inputs.
